# BANK

It appears that your provided code is a C++ program for a simple banking system. The program includes functionalities such as creating an account, displaying account details, and editing the account balance. Additionally, it utilizes file input/output for data storage.

# Here's a brief summary of the main components and functionalities in the code:

### Class Definition (`Account`):

- Represents an individual bank account with attributes such as first name, last name, Cin (assuming it's a unique identifier), and montant (balance).

### Main Function:
- Displays a menu for creating an account, performing operations, displaying account details, and exiting the program.
- Utilizes a switch-case structure to execute the chosen menu option.

### Menu Functions:
- `AddAccount():` Allows the user to create a new bank account and appends the details to a file named "Bank_data.txt."
- `seeAccount():` Enables the user to search for and display details of an account based on Cin from the file.
- `editmontant():` Facilitates the modification of the balance (montant) for a specific account based on Cin.
  
### File Handling:
- Uses file streams (`ifstream` and `ofstream`) to read from and write to a file ("Bank_data.txt").
- Data is stored in a structured format within the file.

### Repetition Function (`repat()`):
- Asks the user if they want to return to the main menu and restart the program.


## Each account entry in the file is formatted with the following structure:
```
Cin: <Cin>
montant: <montant>
first name: <first name>
